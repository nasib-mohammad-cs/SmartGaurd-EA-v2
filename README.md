## ✅ **SmartGuard EA v2.0 – Strategy Overview Report**

### 🎯 **Core Purpose**

SmartGuard EA v2.0 is an MT5 Expert Advisor designed for precision intraday trading using a **tiered execution system**, **multi-timeframe trend confirmation**, **ATR-based TP/SL management**, and **capital-protective filters**.

---

## ⚙️ **Logic Flow**

### 1. **Initialization**

* On start, SmartGuard EA initializes all required indicators:

  * **HalfTrend MA/ATR indicators** for M5, M30, and H1
  * **EMA + RSI indicators** if enabled
  * **ATR handles** for TP/SL and trailing

### 2. **Pre-Trade FilterStack**

Before any trade is considered, a series of strict filters are applied:

* ✅ **Spread Filter:** Rejects trades if spread exceeds `MaxAllowedSpread`
* ✅ **Session Filter (optional):** Limits trading to specified hours
* ✅ **Volatility Filter (optional):** Ensures ATR ≥ `MinATR`
* ✅ **Capital Protector:** Blocks trades during excessive drawdown or equity stress

### 3. **Signal Validator**

Combines **trend logic** from two systems:

#### 📌 A. **HalfTrend Logic (3-TF)**

* MA high/low bands + ATR deviation from **M5, M30, H1**
* All 3 must agree (and be non-zero) to validate the trend:

  * `+1` → Buy trend
  * `-1` → Sell trend
  * `0` → No clear alignment

#### 📌 B. **EMA + RSI Logic (Optional)**

* Buy if:

  * Fast EMA > Slow EMA AND RSI > threshold
* Sell if:

  * Fast EMA < Slow EMA AND RSI < (100 - threshold)

> ✅ **Final Signal Decision:**

* If both HalfTrend and EMA/RSI are active, only matching signals are allowed.
* If only one system is active, its signal is followed.

## 🔁 **Trade Execution – Tiered System**

When a valid signal is detected:

### 🧩 Tiered Entries:

4 trades are placed with equal lot sizes:

* **T1 → TP = ATR × 1**
* **T2 → TP = ATR × 2**
* **T3 → TP = ATR × 3**
* **T4 → TP = ATR × 5** (runner with special logic)

### 📉 Stop Loss:

* **ATR-based SL** applied for all trades
* Tier 4 (T4) may optionally use **break-even stop** instead of a fixed SL

---

## 🔄 **Trailing Stop for Tier 4 (Runner)**

* Initiates when profit > `TrailingStartATRMultiplier × ATR`
* SL follows price with a gap of `TrailingGapATRMultiplier × ATR`
* Respects `UseBreakEvenTP_T4` flag to avoid premature trailing

---

## 🛡️ **Capital & Risk Management**

* **RiskPercentPerTrade** dynamically scales lot size
* **InitialLockRatio** helps preserve a portion of equity as untradable
* **Drawdown protection** enforces equity-based trade blocking
* **Cooldown Timer** prevents overtrading via `TradeCooldownSeconds`
